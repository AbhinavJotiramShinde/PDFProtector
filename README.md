# PDFProtector

A simple Python utility to **create a password-protected PDF** file.

# Features
- Reads an existing PDF and writes a copy that requires a password to open.
- Works on any PDF that is not already encrypted.
- Cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux).

# Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)

Install the dependency:
pip install PyPDF2

Usage
Run from the command line:
python pdf_protector.py <input_pdf> <output_pdf> <password>

Arguments:
<input_pdf> : Path to the source PDF.
<output_pdf> : Path where the password-protected PDF will be saved.
<password> : The password users will need to open the protected file.

Example:
python pdf_protector.py report.pdf report_protected.pdf MySecret123
This creates report_protected.pdf which can only be opened using the password MySecret123.

Notes
Ensure the input PDF is not already encrypted.
Keep your password safeâ€”losing it means you may not be able to open the protected file yourself.
